# 🐾 Animal Species Detection App

This project is an **image classification app** that identifies the **species of animals** from uploaded images.  
It is built using **Streamlit** for the interface and **Google Gemini API** for computer vision + text generation.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect the **animal species** from an uploaded image.  
- Provide its **Domain → Kingdom → Phylum → Order** classification.  
- Deliver results through a simple **Streamlit web app**.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend / App:** Streamlit  
- **Model API:** Google Gemini (1.5 Pro)  
- **Image Processing:** PIL, Base64  
- **Other Tools:** httpx, Python  

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. User uploads an image (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`).  
2. The image is encoded and passed to the **Gemini vision model**.  
3. The model generates the **species name + biological classification**.  
4. Results are displayed on the **Streamlit dashboard** with the uploaded image.
